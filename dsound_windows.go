/*
Package ds provides a wrapper for Microsoft's DirectSound API in pure Go.
It can only be used on Windows.

When running a DirectSound application you need to have dsound.dll installed on
the system, which fortunately has been deployed with all Windows versions since
XP. This means if you have Go installed, you also have the DLL installed. This
also means that your application can be deployed without the DirectX DLLs and if
you have no other dependencies you can just give the executable file to the
users.

NOTE that the prefix DS is left out of all identifiers. In cases where this
makes the name start with "3D", the 3D part is appended to the name instead,
e.g. DS3DBUFFER becomes BUFFER3D.
